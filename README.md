### Move

There are two ways to move in `gambit`:

* Type out the square the piece you want to move is on, then type out the square to which you want to move the piece.
* With the mouse, click on the target piece and target square.

### Play

You can play a game by running:

```
gambit
```

You can press <kbd>ctrl+f</kbd> to flip the board to give a better perspective
for the second player.

### Future

In the future, `gambit` will support:

* networked play, where two players can run
`gabmit unique-room-id` and play together through peer-to-peer communication.

* Single player games, by adding a chess engine
